    <h2>About.</h2>
    <p>Since I was young, I've always been captivated by how things work — not just machines, but ideas, visuals, and the patterns behind them. I used to spend hours dismantling gadgets, sketching out imaginary interfaces, or editing videos just for the joy of seeing ideas come alive on screen. It wasn’t long before I found myself gravitating toward programming, digital art, and simulation — anything that let me blend logic with creativity.</p> <br>

<p>In school, I was the kind of person who jumped between poetry and Python, who enjoyed circuit diagrams as much as video timelines. That mix of curiosity led me to study Computer Science (AI & Data Science) at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, where I continue to explore the spaces between art and engineering. Whether it's building a smart garbage bin with Arduino, simulating planetary motion with MATLAB, or experimenting with AI-powered ray tracing in Blender — I love turning abstract concepts into working reality.</p> <br>

<p>Right now, I'm experimenting. I'm prototyping things, writing code, researching smart systems, and quietly laying the groundwork for stories I hope to tell — whether in pixels, paragraphs, or particles. I don’t know exactly what the future holds, but I know it involves making cool things and telling better stories — stories that connect, inspire, and maybe even help someone feel less alone.</p> <br>

<p><b>If you’re someone who builds, imagines, designs, or just thinks deeply — especially if you’re a young creative — I’d love to connect.</b> The internet has made it easier than ever to create together, and I believe the most interesting things are made by people who care just a little too much. If you’ve read this far, reach out — let’s make something wild.</p>
