    <h2>Hi! I'm Shreyansh Singh.</h2>

    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Shreyansh Singh</strong> — a Computer Science undergraduate at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I'm deeply passionate about building intelligent systems, simulating real-world physics, designing interactive visuals, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code and creativity.</p>

<br />

<p>My current areas of interest include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simulation of Physical Systems (Gravitational Models, Circuit Design)</li>
  <li>Smart Systems and Sensor Technologies</li>
  <li>Graphical Computing and Visual Data Representation</li>
</ul>

<br />

<p>Here’s a quick overview of what I do:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python, Java, MATLAB, MySQL, HTML, CSS</li>
  <li><strong>Libraries & Frameworks:</strong> Pandas, Numpy, TKinter</li>
  <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Blender, Figma, DaVinci Resolve, Git</li>
  <li><strong>Platforms:</strong> Arduino, Android</li>
</ul>

<br />

<p>Some of my recent projects and research work include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Solar System Simulation:</strong> Built a MATLAB-based simulation using transformation matrices to model gravitational interactions and animate orbits of inner planets. Collaborated under the guidance of Dr. Rakesh Kumar and Mr. Jayprakash.</li>
  <li><strong>Sound Signal Compression:</strong> Developed a MATLAB script to reduce and analyze sound data using time-domain reduction techniques. Created for the “Mathematics for Intelligent Systems” course.</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Garbage Bin:</strong> Designed an IoT-enabled bin using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors that alerts when full — part of a smart system initiative.</li>
  <li><strong>AI in Ray Tracing:</strong> Authored a research paper on optimizing rendering in Blender using neural denoising and AI models. (Link to paper will be added upon publication.)</li>
</ul>

<br />

<p>I’ve also worked as a <strong>3D Modeller at Catrock Services</strong>, where I created promotional assets and 3D visuals using Blender for branding and client products.</p>

<br />

<p>Certifications & Programs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python Bootcamp (Udemy)</li>
  <li>MAOM (Mastery Over Mind) — Focus and Meditation Training</li>
</ul>

<br />
